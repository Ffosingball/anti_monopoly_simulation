In summer 2024 I bought the board game Anti-monopoly.
I played that game many times with my family and every
time monopolists were winners, never competitors. 
However in the rulebook it says that monopolists and 
competitors have equal chance for winning.
Therefore I decided to make a simulation of this game
to see whether I and my family play wrong or 
monopolists in reality have much higher of winning than
competitors.
